# Stock Analysis
## Overview of Project
In this project, we helped Steve analyze stock data. His parents wanted to be his first investors and chose the "DQ" stock in the beginning. After analyzing the "DQ" stock, it had a negative return of 63%. So, we did a new analysis which would expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years, specfically 2017 and 2018. Through the use of VBA in Excel, we refactored the orginal code we used,to help Steve sift through thousands of stocks in a timely manner. 
## Results
Since we are analyzing larger amounts of data with Steve in this analysis, we refeactored the code from our orignal analysis. We used three different arrays of data to showcase this in refactoring - the ticker (name of Stock abbreviated), Total Daily Volume, and Annual Return. These three arrays gave us a good visualization of the stock information needed to advise Steve and his investors. Refactoring helped our code run within seconds as seen in the images below.

Now with the two charts of 2017 and 2018 stock below, we can see that only ENPH and RUN stayed positive through both years. Therefore, these stocks seem to have been affected in some way from one year to the next and Steve can look into this more if desired.

## Summary
There are advantages and disadvantages to refactoring code. Some advantages are making it more efficient by taking fewer steps, using less memory, and improving the logic of the code to make it eaiser for others to read it. Some disadvantages are figuring out the best way to refactor code. With time and experience I think it will get easier to refactor code when I have more knowledge of coding and VBA.
